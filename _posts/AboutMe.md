# About Me
Hello, I am Vaaruni Sundar. I am a Psychotherapist in private pratice based out of Bangalore, India. I am in the process of being a Certified Transactional Analyst and pursuing my qualifying course in Group Analysis.

I have worked with adults and adolescents with a range of psychological vulnerabiliies making my experience diverse. My primary method of practice is through individual and group work.

I understand therapy as a journey which offers enough support and challenge for growth and change. My primary therapeutic stance is intergrative and psychodynamic with an inquiry into socio-political and power differences that seep into our narratives influencing the way we relate with ourself and others. 

I adhere to the ethical framework of SAATA (The South Asian Association of Transactional Analysts) and ITAA (International Transactional Analysis Association).
